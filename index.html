		<h2>Chicken</h2>
		<p>Take 1 kilogram of freshly cut chicken and wash and rinse it properly to get rid of any unwanted microbes<br>. Then add all the listed ingredients.
		Onion, salt, garam masala, curd, haldi, spices, etc.<br>Then mix all of it together and put it on medium steam on the pressure cooker then add 3.5 table spoons of oil and wait for 45 minutes patiently.<br> Then take it off the flame chop corinder leaves and some fried ring onions and you are good to go.<h3>Tast treat awaits you!!!</h3></p>
		</div>

		<div class="col column2">
		<h2>Beef</h2>
		<p>Put a nice cast-iron pan over a medium heat- but don't add any oil. When the pan gets up to the temperature, add the steaks<br> but start them on their fatty edges, not flat first. The plan is to render some of the fat and brown edges slightly.<br>
		Keep moving the steak around until all the fat has been browned. At this point, you should tip the steak on one<br> side and cook it in its own fat for a few minutes, then flip and cook the other side. Then add a generous helping of butter and crushed garlic.<br><h3>There's nothing quite like good old style beef steak!!!</h3>.</p> 
	    </div>

	    <div class="col column3">
	    <h2>Lamb</h2>
	    <p>Purchase lamb chops that are about 1-inch thick, so that you can brown both sides without overcooking the center (for lamb, you are looking for a medium-rare cook,145 degree farhenite).<br>Cut them according to your personal preferance, then saute the minced shallots, crushed garlic and a fresh sprig of thyme in rendered fat until glossy and brown, then<br> deglaze the pan with white wine or chicken broth and lemon juice, being sure to scrape up the fond. Serve the chops with mashed potato or polenta to catch the pool of sauce.<br> <h3>Finally raise the toast with friends and family and savour the taste of lamb chops!!!</h3></p>
